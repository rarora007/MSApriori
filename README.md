# MSApriori
An implementation of the MSApriori Algorithm for pattern mining of frequent item sets. Using multiple minimum item supports for different items, the algorithm helps detect rare item rules without generating any irrelevant rules. Different constraints were introduced to limit the output size of frequent item sets for efficient rule generation while meeting specific user requirements.
